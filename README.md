# [Thinking in React: Functional Components][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


The very first thing you learn when studying React is writing components. Components are, after all, the life-blood of React. But our components aren't always the best they can be, especially if we try to do too much within a single component.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you how to architect your components based on the single-responsibilty principle in order to make your components easier to maintain. You'll also learn best practices when it comes to writing stateless components.
